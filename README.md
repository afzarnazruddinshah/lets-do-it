# Let's Do It - The Mentor We All Need
This is a Productivity tool to help people increase their productivity and utilize their time efficiently.

### Problem Statement:
Most of us believe we are not having enough time to do what we want to do. We end up procrastinating, losing our time and our opportunities, thereby embracing misery. Even if we start something new, for example, doing an online course, we fall short, not continuing the efforts.

### Solution:
We need a companion. We need a Mentor who can guide us through the hardships, make us realize that we have more time than needed, provide timely feedback and be a part of our Success Story.

### Goals Of this Project:
To help people increase their productivity
To help people utilize their time efficiently
To help people complete what they are procrastinating

### What this Project Accomplishes:
Reminds us of our goals and tasks
Help us track our progress over time
Provide timely feedback to improve areas we are lacking efficiency
Help us maintain list of things to accomplish

### Design Platform:
The Application should be accessible across multiple devices, be it a smartphone or a laptop. The application should be available wherever the user is.

### Tech Stack:
React Js for Frontend, Python Django for Backend. Hosted in GitHub Pages and Heroku. We aim to incorporate ML in preparing the Feedback and Analysis Report later in the development, so Python Django will be a good choice.

### First Stable Release:
We are planning to deliver the first Stable Release by December 31, 2021.
